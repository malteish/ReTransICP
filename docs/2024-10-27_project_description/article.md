# **ReTransICP**

## **Project highlights**

ReTransICP is a tool designed to facilitate recurring on-chain transactions on EVM blockchains, leverating the Internet Computer (ICP) to do so. It is intended for blockchain users of any kind who need automated transaction scheduling and execution. The project addresses the complexity of handling recurring transactions in a decentralized manner, ensuring that users can automate payments and other routine transfers seamlessly.

## **Features**

- **Recurring Transaction Scheduling:** Centralized smart contract for scheduling payments on various chains.
- **EVM Compatibility:** Supports integration with EVM-based chains, enabling widespread use.
- **Event-driven Execution:** Listens for events and triggers actions using ICP's canisters and ECDSA threshold signatures.
- **On-Chain Payments:** Facilitates automated on-chain payments with flexibility for different transaction types and schedules.

## **Usage Example**

Alice wants to send Bob 10 EURe every week. She creates a recurring transaction on the web app and sets the parameters. Bob will receive the 10 EURe every week. Both are happy.

## **Documentation**

Using the web app as a user should be straightforward.

Documentation for development is available in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/malteish/ReTransICP). It includes setup instructions, API references, and detailed usage examples.

## **License**

ReTransICP is open-source and uses the MIT License, allowing broad usage and modification.
