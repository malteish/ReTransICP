 * @notice This contract allows for the creation of jobs that are executed with a fixed periodicity.
 * The first example implementation is a contract that sends a fixed amount of tokens to a recipient every period.
 * With very little modification, this contract could be used to do all sorts of naughty things. Be careful.
 * @dev In order to automatically execute the jobs, the contract needs to be triggered by an external entity.
 * This entity is expected to call the executeJob function at the right time. We leverage an Internet Computer
 * Canister for this purpose. The entity, called "trigger" in this contract, is expected to listen to the
 * NextExecutionTimestamp event, and call the executeJob function when THE TIME HATH COME1!1!
